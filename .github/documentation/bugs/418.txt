                    Repaired Errors (418)

The bug '418' is in the file (index.html) and it's caused
  because the index HTML file does not implements the css
  file '\assets\minecraft\styles\gameplay.css'.

How i solved it?, Easy only you only have to implement the
  CSS file '\assets\minecraft\styles\gameplay.css' to
  the index HTML file, on the <head> tag.

Code:
    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/minecraft/styles/gameplay.css">`
