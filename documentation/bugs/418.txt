  because the index HTML file does not implements the css
  file '\assets\minecraft\styles\gameplay.css'.

How'd solved? Easy, it are easy to solve, only you should
  implement the CSS file '\assets\minecraft\styles\gameplay.css'
  to the index HTML file, on the <head> tag.

Code:
    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/minecraft/styles/gameplay.css">`
